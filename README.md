## My Approach

The main objective was to **redesign the entire page** to look **completely different from the original** while maintaining functionality.

### Key changes:

- **Sidebar Layout**
  I introduced a sidebar layout to better organize the content and improve navigation.

- **Refactored Navigation & Sidebar**
  I refactored both the navigation bar and sidebar into modular components to make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

- **Linting with Husky**
  I Integrated Husky to enforce linting rules before any commit is pushed

- **Skip Selection Modal**
  When a skip is selected, a modal pops up to display full details, including a larger image and relevant information . I used this inorder to improve the user experience.

- **Size-Based Filtering**
  I Added a filter dropdown to allow users to easily filter skips by size, making it quicker to find what they need.

- **Grid/List View Toggle**
  Implemented view toggles (grid and list) so users can choose their preferred way of viewing the skips.

- **Mobile Navigation Slide-in**
  On smaller screens, I made the Sidebar smoothly slide in from the left, this would enhance the mobile experience and keep the UI clean .
